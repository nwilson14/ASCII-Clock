# ASCII-Clock
This program takes military times (e.g. 18:45 or 09:01) from the standard input and displays them with 
dashes, lines and plus signs onto the standard output.

This is an assignment completed in my Programming in a Second Language course at Florida Tech. It is
a relatively simply program and is one of the first Python programs I wrote.
